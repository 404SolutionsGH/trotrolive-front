This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Update README to Include `.env` File Instructions

### Add the `.env` File
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add the following entry to specify the Django API URL:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your_django_api_url>
   ```

   Replace `<NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL>` with the actual URL of your Django API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` for local development or your production URL).

3. Save the file. Make sure the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

### Example `.env` File
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
